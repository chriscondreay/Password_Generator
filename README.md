# Password_Generator

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to allow the user to generate a password based on alerts and confirming what types of characters they would like included into their password

The password can include uppercase, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. The user is also allowed to input how long he would like the password to be.

## Motivation
The motivation for this project was to make it so it was a lot easier for people to generate a password if they couldn't think of a password themselves or if they would like to interperet an extremely complicated password so that they knew it was safe and secure.

## Solving a Problem 
This allows a lot of users as said to generate a complicated password that is randomly generated so that way anyone who may want to access sensitive content or account won't be able to as the password would be extremely complicated to retrieve.
